# NNTCaPip
Image and data processing pipeline for calcium imaging

The main focus of this pipline is to create a one stop shop for analysis of in vivo calcium imgages. This data pipline includes general fluorescence mapping, spike counts, and spike rates. Along with more intensive coactive indexing, spatial temporal correlations, shuffling, and PCA analysis using SVD for network assemblies.
