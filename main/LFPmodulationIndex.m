%% Modulation probability
% we reasoned that limitations in calcium sensitivity, baseline levels and
% ripple amplitude can influence the response activity seen in different
% subtypes. To circumvent those limitations, we developed a measure of
% modulation to evaluate whether a cell had an increased activity during a
% SWR event statistically higher than its baseline fluctuation during
% immobility. To do so, we computed for each cell a shuffle distribution
% that consisted of 1000 values. Each value was the average of N randomly
% chosen Î”F/F points during immobility (N corresponds to the number of SWRs
% detected in the session). Then, for each SWR, if the difference in
% activity in a 400ms window centered around the onset was greater than the
% 95th percentile of the shuffle distribution, the cell was modulated
% during this event. The modulation probability reports the percentage of
% SWRs leading to an increase above baseline.
